# Troubleshooting errors when uploading yaml or json files in Shuffle

### Steps to follow:

1. Use an OpenAPI validator to make sure the data is correct. Example: https://editor.swagger.io/
2. If you see errors, go to the line that is displayed and try to modify that line and upload again. 
3. Continue doing so and making corrections until the upload is successful without any errors.
